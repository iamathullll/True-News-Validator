Fake News Detection Using NLP and Machine Learning
Overview
TrueNews Validator is an interactive web application that detects whether a news article is "Real" or "Fake" using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. Built with Streamlit, this project aims to tackle misinformation by providing an easy-to-use tool for fake news classification.

Features
Real-time Classification: Input news text and classify it as "Real" or "Fake."
High Accuracy: Achieved 97% accuracy with Logistic Regression.
NLP Pipeline: Preprocessed text using SpaCy for lemmatization and stopword removal.
Feature Engineering: Used TF-IDF vectorization to transform unstructured text into numerical data.
Technical Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation
scikit-learn: Model training and evaluation
SpaCy: Text preprocessing
Streamlit: Web application
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression (97% accuracy)
Multinomial Naive Bayes (92% accuracy)
How It Works
Preprocessing:
Lemmatization, stopword removal, and punctuation filtering using SpaCy.
Model Training:
Trained Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features for optimal accuracy.
User Interaction:
Users input text via the Streamlit interface to classify news in real-time.

Results
Logistic Regression achieved 97% accuracy, with an F1-score of 0.94 on the test dataset.
Multinomial Naive Bayes achieved 92% accuracy, making Logistic Regression the final choice.
Future Enhancements
Expand dataset to include multilingual news articles.
Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for improved performance.
Deploy the app online for wider accessibility.
